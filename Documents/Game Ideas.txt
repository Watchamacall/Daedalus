2D platformer, can't see but can see rain, platform with only being able to see that rain droplets
Like Stanley Parable, narrative driven, looks at having narrator which communicates with player. Similar to thing saying take off shoes and complying.
Until Dawn based game, 3D horror narrative driven
Labyrinth game, Greek inspired.

										Totally Reliable Narrator
Unreliable narrator, telling you to jump when it isn't safe. Not being able to see and that. (MAIN IDEA)
	See player and a little bit ahead of you but that's it. Relying on the narrator to guide you.
	2D style, will need pixel art??
	Platformer style, will need to platform but narrator can give false hope into jumping.
	2 Narrators, one good one bad (Angel and Devil) (Potential)
	Labryinth element within the game as well, 2 stages perhaps (Changing from side to top down) (2.5D??)
	Wooded area to potentially enter, having to run from a monster, narrator could be saying where he is or lying, leading you to the monster.
	Narrator acts weirder throughout the gameplay and turns out that he is killer potentially?
	
	Issue with narration timing?
	
	Shadhad bunny is EE? In easter egg
